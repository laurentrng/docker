# Objectives

Create a simulator that send temperature data in the following JSON format:

{
  ts: TIMESTAMP
  type: "temp"
  value: VALUE,
  sensor_id: ID_OF_THE_DEVICE_SENDING_THE_DATA
}

For instance, a valid data could be the following one

{
  ts: "2017-03-01T23:12:52Z",
  type: "temp",
  value: 34,
  sensor_id: 123
}

In the real world, those data would be sent by a real device and represent the temperature with value 34 sent by the device which id is 123 and collected on the 2017-03-01T23:12:52Z (date in ISO8601 format).
# The simulator

The simulator can be done in any language, on the current example it's done in bash shell. It's a very minimal, and only

    get the current date
    generate a random number for the temperature (quite hot location btw)
    send the data in JSON using the curl command (note: the targeted API will run on port 1337 as we will see in the next step)
    wait 1 seconds and repeat

An example of the simulator is provided in the step0 folder, you can copy it to the root of the iot-api folder.
